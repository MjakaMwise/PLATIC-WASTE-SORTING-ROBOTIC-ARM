# Plastic Sorting Robotic Arm 🤖♻️

## Overview

This project showcases a **robotic arm** capable of **detecting, picking, and sorting plastic waste** based on predefined parameters such as **color, type, or size**. The aim is to demonstrate how robotics and automation can support **sustainable recycling practices** by reducing manual effort and improving sorting efficiency.

## Features

* 🔍 **Plastic detection** using sensors (or optional computer vision).
* ✋ **Robotic arm manipulation** to pick and place objects.
* ♻️ **Automated sorting** into designated bins (e.g., PET, HDPE, LDPE).
* ⚡ **Real-time control system** for efficient operation.
* 🌍 Focus on **environmental sustainability** through smart waste management.

## Tech Stack

* **Hardware**: Robotic arm, servo motors, sensors (IR/Color/Camera).
* **Software**: Arduino / Raspberry Pi for microcontroller logic.
* **Libraries**: OpenCV (if vision-based sorting), control libraries for motor actuation.
* **Languages**: C++ (Arduino), Python (for image processing/AI).

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The sensor or camera identifies the type of plastic.
2. **Decision**: Control logic classifies the item into the correct category.
3. **Action**: The robotic arm picks the item and places it in the designated bin.
4. **Feedback**: System logs or LEDs confirm successful sorting.

## Applications

* ✅ Recycling centers.
* ✅ Educational projects in robotics & AI.
* ✅ Demonstrating real-world use of automation in environmental sustainability.

## Future Improvements

* 🧠 AI-based classification for higher accuracy.
* 📊 Data collection on sorted materials.
* 🔋 Energy-efficient operation.
